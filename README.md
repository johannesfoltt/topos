# topos

This is the lean formalization accompanying my bachelor's thesis "Formalization of the internal language of a topos".
It is a fork of [CharedLee/topos](https://github.com/CharredLee/topos), which itself is a Lean 4 port of content from the Lean 3 topos library at [b-mehta/topos](https://github.com/b-mehta/topos).
